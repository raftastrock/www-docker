# Docker Webteam
This repo is for webteam's server infrastructure on docker.

# Steps
* Intall Docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
	* Increase memory in docker (in app preferences)
* Navigate to /docker-webteam folder
* Run `docker-compose up -d`
* Go to http://localhost in your browser
* Notes
	* You need to be on the office network or vpnd into the office in order to download some of the files form mirrors.liferay
	* If you want to build only liferay you can navigate to the liferay folder and run `docker build -t liferay . && docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name liferay liferay`
	* If you are seeing issues with apache and conflicting ports on mac you can run `sudo apachectl stop`
	* You can run `docker ps -a` to see the containers and their statuses
	* For logs run `docker logs -f [CONTAINER_ID|CONTAINER_NAME]` ie `docker logs -f liferay`
	* To navigate the terminal of a container run  `docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID|CONTAINER_NAME] /bin/sh` ie `docker exec -it mariadb /bin/sh`
	* To shut down all of your containers run `docker-compose down`
	* To rebuild your containers as you bring them up run `docker-compose up -d --build`
	* To copy files from your computer to a docker container run `docker cp [containerName]:[containerPath] [localPath]` ie `docker cp liferay:/usr/local/liferay-dxp-digital-enterprise-7.0-sp6/deploy ~/Desktop/dxp/deploy/`

# What is installed
If you look at the docker-compose.yaml you can see all of the containers and settings that are being installed. These include
* Web Server
	* Using apache
	* This handles the intial request when you hit http://localhost and directs you to the liferay instance
* Database Server
	* Using mariadb
	* This is a separate server for the database to provide easier scalability
	* If you set the `DB_URL` variable in docker-compose.yaml it will download and source your database for you (not working yet)
* Search Server
	* Using elasticsearch
	* This is a dedicated server to store search indexes
	* You can see the indexes at http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
* Email Server
	* Using mockmock
	* This is just for testing so that you can send emails from liferay and see them at http://localhost:8282
* Liferay Instance
	* This is your running instance of liferay
	* Notice you can add files to the `/www-docker/liferay/configs` or `/www-docker/liferay/deploy` folders and when you start up your server it will deploy these files for you using the entrypoint.sh script
	* If you set the `MODULES_URL` in docker-compose.yaml it will download and deploy your modules from a github repo (not working yet)
